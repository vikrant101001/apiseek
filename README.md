- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: View data such as:
  - Request Name
  - Request Type (HTTP Method)
  - Total Requests (since server startup)
  - Successful Requests
  - Failed Requests
  - Average Response Time
  - Minimum Response Time
  - Median Response Time
  - Maximum Response Time
  - Most Recent Call (Timestamp & Response Time)

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn

### Step 1: Prepare Your FastAPI Application

Ensure you have FastAPI and Uvicorn installed and your API endpoints are up and running. For example, you can install them via:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```
### Step 3: Integrate APISKEEK into Your Application
Install apiseek

```bash
pip install apiseek==0.2
```

Add the following code to your FastAPI application (e.g., in your main.py):
```bash
from fastapi import FastAPI
from apiseek import init_app

app = FastAPI()

# Initialize APISKEEK (dashboard will be available at /apiseek)
init_app(app)

# Define your API endpoints below
@app.get("/hello")
def hello():
    return {"message": "Hello, world!"}
```

### Dashboard
Run your application using Uvicorn:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Then, open your browser and navigate to
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/apiseek
```
or
```bash
localhost:8000/apiseek
```
You'll see the clean, intuitive dashboard displaying all the key metrics for your API endpoints.
